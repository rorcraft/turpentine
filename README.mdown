# turpentine

A delightful Twitter/Ruby on Rails learning project.

## How to use

1. `sudo gem install json rest-open-uri yaml`
1. Rename `config-example.yaml` to `config.yaml`
1. Edit the username and password to match yours
1. `chmod +x turpentine.rb`
1. `./turpentine.rb`

## Issues

* It would be good to verify that successful responses have a 200 code. I’m not
sure how to do it; `rest-open-uri` doesn’t seem to expose such information.
